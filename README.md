Background

This project is a lost and found system designed for the school. It aims to make the process of reporting and retrieving items more efficient, faster and organized. This project replaces traditional manual methods with a system that allows the users to report and keep track of their lost items. This allows users to easily report and track their belongings with ease.  

Project Description

Objectives

To create a Lost and Found system with secure login, verification, and chat features.
To foster honesty in the XU community through the use of the Lost and Found system.
To create an unbiased Lost and Found system.
To create a reliable and efficient Lost and Found system.
Scope
The scope of this project includes the creation of a secure and functional Lost and Found System equipped with key features to streamline the process of reporting and recovering items such as:
User Registration and Login:
 Secure authentication system that allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles to ensure accountability and privacy.


Item Reporting (Lost & Found):
 Users can upload pictures, descriptions, and other details of lost or found items to the system for visibility and tracking.


Verification System:
 A feature to confirm item ownership, reducing false claims and ensuring that items are returned to the rightful owner.


Chat System:
 Users are able to chat with staff that are in charge with keeping the lost and coordinate with them the retrieval process of their item.


Activity Logging:
A record-keeping feature that maintains a log of all item reports, verifications, and user activities for reliability and transparency.
Methodology
The technical approach that will be used to develop this lost and found system is an Agile methodology. This methodology helps ensure that this project’s development process is flexible and effective. This approach divides the progress into small tasks with a specific focus each week. This process will help the project fix issues along the way and have a good-quality system.
